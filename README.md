# credit-risk-classification
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify loan risks based on historical lending data. The goal is to predict whether a loan is healthy or at high risk of default.

# Background
The dataset used in this project comes from a peer-to-peer lending services company and contains information about loans, including the status of the loan (healthy or high-risk). We use this data to train and evaluate a logistic regression model to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers.

# Steps
1. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets:

* Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Separate the labels (loan_status) from the features.
* Split the data into training and testing sets.
  
2. Logistic Regression Model:

* Train a logistic regression model using the training set.
* Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using a confusion matrix and classification report.
* Analyze how well the model predicts healthy vs. high-risk loans.

3. Credit Risk Analysis Report:

* A summary of the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
